intent: Intepretable models help to facilitate users, developers, and auditors to understand and account for the results of your ML application. #
motivation: Description of the importance of using this practice #
applicability: Non-interpretable models often only provide a small performance gain over an interpretable alternative. Interpretability should not be sacrificed for performance without making a well-considered trade-off decision.  #
