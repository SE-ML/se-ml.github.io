Although different team members have their own style of managing experiments and tracing their outcomes, it is recommended to adopt a common way of logging data; that is understood and accessible to all team members.


Sharing the outcomes within the team has several benefits for peer review, knowledge transfer and model assessment.


Several <a href="https://github.com/SE-ML/awesome-seml#tooling">collaborative tools</a> enable central logging of experimental results.

Whenever possible, it is recommended to use one of the tools available internally or externally (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/SE-ML/awesome-seml#tooling">Sacred or W&B</a>).
