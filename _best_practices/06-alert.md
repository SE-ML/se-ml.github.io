intent: Make users aware that machine learning is used by the application, what it is used for, and what its limitations are. This allows users to understand better how to use, or not use the application. #
motivation:  Machine learning systems should not represent themselves as humans to users. Humans have the right to know that they are interacting with a machine learning system. #
applicability: User communication should be applied to any machine learning application. #
related: [concerns]
dependencies: #
survey_question: Q100 #
survey_item: Our application informs users that it makes use of machine learning and describes its intended use and limitations.

labels: [transparency]

The following is an extract from the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai">EU ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI</a>:

> [AI] users should be able to make informed autonomous decisions regarding AI systems. They should be given the knowledge and tools to comprehend and interact with AI systems to a satisfactory degree and, where possible, be enabled to reasonably self-assess or challenge the system.
> [Moreover, ...] AI system should not  represent  themselves  as  humans  to  users; humans have  the  right  to  be informed  that they  are  interacting  with  an  AI  system.  This  entails  that AI  systems must be identifiable  as  such.  In addition,  the  option  to  decide  against  this  interaction  in  favour  of  human  interaction  should  be  provided where needed  to  ensure  compliance  with  fundamental  rights.

The potential impact of artificial intelligence and machine learning on society calls for mature and responsible uses and regulations of these technologies.
Since machine learning can be deployed to shape or influence human behaviour through mechanisms that can be difficult to detect, failing to inform users of machine learning use may violate human rights.
Communicating that decisions that can impact users are made through machine learning increases transparency and helps users make better decisions.

Communication with users can be made through labels that inform of machine learning usage, and through public descriptions of the machine learning system (e.g. through model cards).
