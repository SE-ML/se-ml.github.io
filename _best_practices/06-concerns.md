Communication channels between users and developers can help to discuss issues, dilemmas or emergent concerns regarding ethical use of ML.
In order to facilitate communication, increase transparency and obtain feedback for your application, it is recommended to provide safe channels for users to raise concerns.

These channels can be as simple as mailing lists, blogs (e.g., Disqus) or phone numbers.
Make sure to include options for anonymisation in order to protect the users' privacy and be as inclusive as possible.
