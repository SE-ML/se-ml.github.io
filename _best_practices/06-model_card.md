intent: Models without a nuanced understanding of their capabilities and limits can easily lead to misuse.
motivation: Providing prospective users and/or the public with a clear description of the models' strengths, biases, and shortcomings must be a part of responsible open-sourcing. This way, misguided applications and public distrust can be averted.
applicability: Clear documentation must be distributed together with the models in all cases where models are made accessible to third parties.

ML models are not perfect, and their imperfections can often be unintuitive to interpret. Therefore, it is expected of their creators to ensure that the model's users have a precise understanding of its boundaries. This includes measured performance, the means of measuring that, for instance, evaluation metrics and data used, and known edge cases.

Documentation can come in many shapes, but <a href="https://modelcards.withgoogle.com/about" target="_blank">Model Cards</a>, pioneered by Google, are a safe choice for starting out. They allow a large degree of freedom while still containing a good structure for the document.

Model Cards or, in general, documentation of machine learning models should be aimed at both technical and non-technical audiences. It's not only for the engineers looking to apply it but also for the end-users whose data it might be applied to, and legal or other governing professionals who oversee the safety, legality, and ethics of the model's usage.
