intent: To identify and mitigate possible unintended negative impact of your ML application. #
motivation: Your ML application potentially could have unintended negative impact on your users, your own organisation, other organisations, or society at large. A risk assessment is a deliberate, structured process to identify such risks before they occur, so mitigating measures can be designed and implemented.  #
applicability: At least one risk assessment should be conducted for any ML application before it goes live. When the stakes are higher (e.g., safety-relevant, vulnerable users, involves personal information), risk assessments should be conducted more frequently and more thoroughly. #
