An ever-increasing number of organisations are developing applications that involve machine learning (ML) components. The complexity and diversity of these applications calls for engineering techniques to ensure they are built in a **robust** and **future-proof** manner.

On this website we collect, validate and share engineering best practices for software including ML components.
To this end, <a href="/members">we</a> study the scientific and popular literature and engage with machine learning practitioners.

For more information access our <a href="/practices/">catalogue of ML engineering best practices</a> or read our report on the <a href="/report2020">State of Engineering Practices for Machine Learning</a>.
