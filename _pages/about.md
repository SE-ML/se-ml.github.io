An ever-increasing number of organisations are developing applications that involve machine learning components. The complexity and diversity of these applications calls for engineering techniques to ensure that they are built in a **robust** and **future-proof** manner.

On this website we collect, validate and share engineering best practices for software including ML components.
To this end, <a href="/members">we</a> study the scientific and popular literature and engage with machine learning practitioners.
