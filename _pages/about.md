An ever-increasing number of organisations are developing applications that involve machine learning components. The complexity and diversity of these applications calls for software engineering techniques to ensure that they are built in a **robust** and **future-proof** manner.

*Do traditional software engineering practices apply equally to the development of applications with ML components, or do these practices need to be adapted to cater for particular ML characteristics?*

To investigate this question, we study the scientific and popular literature and engage with machine learning practitioners.
