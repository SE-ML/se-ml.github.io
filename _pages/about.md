An ever-increasing number of organisations are involved in the development of applications that involve machine learning components. The complexity and diversity of these applications calls for software engineering techniques to ensure that they are built in a **robust** and **future-proof** manner.

Do traditional software engineering practices apply equally to the development of ML applications, or do these practices need modification to cater particular ML characteristics?

To investigate this question, we study the scientific and popular literature and engage with machine learning practitioners.
