We have reviewed both scientific literature and popular publications to identify **29** engineering best practices that were recommended or used by teams that develop machine learning applications.

Based on the identified practices, we created a **10**-minute online survey that asks respondents to what extent they are adopting those practices.

We will share the results of the survey on this website.
