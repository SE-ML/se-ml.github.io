In case you are using supervised learning algorithms, labels are crucial for any algorithm to work well.
However, labeling large quantities of data is not trivial.
Incorrect labels introduce noise and may lead to sub-optimal results.
At first, data labeling raises challenges because the volume of data is large.
Secondly, choosing labels is a subjective activity and may introduce bias or noise.

Imposing a strictly controlled process for data labeling guarantees that your algorithm is served with the best data and helps to avoid later issues related to model debugging and error tracing.
