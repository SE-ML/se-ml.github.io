Good data management and sharing is important for several reasons:
- access control,
- virtualization,
- versioning,
- maintainainability and freshness.

Many applications deal with high data volumes.
Transfering or copying a high volume of data is not trivial.
Making datasets avaiable on shared infrastructuure (e.g. S3 Buckets, mountable disks) helps mitigate all these issues.
Moreover, it can provide tracebility.
