Ensuring that someone in a team is in charge of the information regarding a feature facilitates feature maintenability and improves the overall understanding of the model.


Although feature names can be descriptive, it is important to also document the rationale in order to facilitate communication and share the knowledge among team members.


This practice assumes that whenever a feature owner is leaving a team, the ownership is transfered to other members.
