Errors and bugs can easily slip in the code during development.
In order to enhance code quality, techniques from standard programming -- such as peer review -- can also be applied to machine learning code.

Peer review is a well known technique, in which members of the team review the code between themselves.
This technique is known to help with:

- avoiding errors,
- debugging,
- incident response,
- knowledge transfer.
