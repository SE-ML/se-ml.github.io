When working in a diverse team, it is important to understand the background and roles of each member in order to avoid miscomunnications and misunderstandings.
In some cases different team members may fail to agree on the true objective.


Sharing a clearly defined objective within the team assumes the training objective can be converged towards each member, using specific disciplinary language and terminology.


This practice ensures that effort is not spent on futile activities and enhances team communication and efficiency.
