The governance objectives appropriate for a given ML application depend on factors such as:
- the type of **data** being processed: for example, when personal information is processed, privacy objectives are relevant
- the **usage** context: for example, when used for autonomous driving, safety objectives are relevant
- the **organisational** context: for example, a government agency may require usage of open data and non-prorietary ML algorithms

To set governance objectives for your Machine Learning application, you can refer to a general governance framework and/or set objectives specific for your situation. General governance frameworks that you may want to refer to include:
- <a href="https://ai.google/responsibilities/responsible-ai-practices">Google Responsible AI</a>
- <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai">Microsoft AI principles</a>
- <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai">European Commission High-Level Expert Group - Ethical guidelines for trustworthy AI</a>

These frameworks set high-level objectives for concerns such as security, privacy, and fairness. They can be complemented or refined for your specific situation.
