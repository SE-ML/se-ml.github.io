<h2 style="color: black;">Survey on Software Engineering Best Practices for Machine Learning</h2>
<br>

We are running an online survey to measure the adoption of software engineering practices by teams that develop applications with machine learning components.

<h3> Please <a class="blue" href="https://leidenuniv.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cJhJOkx3CIm8sEB">take our 7-minute survey</a>. </h3>

We do not collect any personal information. All answers are processed confidentially.
We will share the lessons learnt from the survey through a freely available publication.
<br><br>

We built the survey by engaging with practitioners and identifying recommended practices in relevant literature.
Based on this information, we also published an <a href="https://github.com/SE-ML/awesome-seml/blob/master/readme.md" target="_blank" class="blue">aweseome list</a> with the most interesting articles, blogs, whitepapers, and tools that we have come across.
<br><br>

If you have questions about the survey, or you would like to share feedback on the survey with us after you have taken it, feel free to drop us an <a href="mailto:j.m.w.visser@liacs.leidenuniv.nl" class="blue">e-mail</a>.
