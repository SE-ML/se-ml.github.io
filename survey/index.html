Survey
<br><br>

We are running an online survey to measure the adoption of software engineering practices by teams that develop applications with machine learning components.
<br><br>

Please [surveylink](take our 12-minute survey).
<br><br>

We do not collect any personal information. All answers are processed confidentially. We will share the lessons learnt from the survey through a freely available publication. 
<br><br>

We built the survey by engaging with practitioners and identify recommended practices in relevant literature. 
<br><br>

We have published an <a href="https://github.com/SE-ML/awesome-seml" target="_blank" style="color:red;">aweseome list</a> with the most interesting articles, blogs, whitepapers, and tools that we have com across. 
<br><br>
